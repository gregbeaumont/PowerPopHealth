## Intro to Power Pop Health ##

Power Pop Health is a collection of content intended to simplify the process of ingesting and prepping Healthcare Open Data for analytics and other uses. Three basic factors contributed to the initial release:
1. Quite often I encounter teams eager to do analytics, but struggling to get source data into an easy-to-use and scalable location.
2. Very few examples exist in the public domain for shaping and modeling Healthcare data for Business Intelligence and Analytics. Concepts such as efficient ETL/ELT, Data Modeling, and scalable enterprise data marts/warehouses often require extrapolating examples unrelated to Healthcare.
3. Over the last 5 years I have accumulated examples and tutorials for items 1-2. The first release is a repository to share all of those examples in a unified format, and in one place. Future additions to Power Pop Health will be based on feedback from the community, with an initial plan to focus primarily on Population Health data.
