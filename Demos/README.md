<b>Regression Demo Example</b>
This is the Power BI PBIX file for the Custom Regression Trendline with DAX in Power BI article and video that I published. I filtered the data set down to one year of data, and cut some unused columns from the dimensions in order to fit it under the file size limits for GitHub. If you want to add the rest of the data (12M+ rows) you can redirect the Power Query connections to DataFlows created from the following sources:

<i>CDC Population_Weighted_UV_Irradiance</i> - https://github.com/gregbeaumont/PowerPopHealth/tree/main/CDC
<i>FIPS States and Counties</i> - https://github.com/gregbeaumont/PowerPopHealth/tree/main/Geography%20Data
<i>Date Script</i> - https://github.com/gregbeaumont/PowerPopHealth/tree/main/Date%20%26%20Time%20Scripts
